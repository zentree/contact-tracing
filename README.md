# contact-tracing

On 8 June 2020 I asked the following question to New Zealand District Health Boards and Ministry of Health:

> Based on the Official Information Act, please provide me with a table with the number of people working in COVID-19 contact tracing for each day from 1 December 2019 to 31 May 2020.

This repository compiles the replies from the DHB in two CSV files:

* contact-tracers.csv: A count of the number of contact tracers.
* dhb-info: Comments on the type of information each DHB provided.

There is also basic R code to summarise data and plot it in:

* quick-look.R: which assumes there is a project file providing the location of the data files.
